Scripts for streamlining cross-correlation analysis for multiple data sets.

Pearson coefficient is a basic measure of cross-correlation for time-series data that permits construction of confidence intervals.  Two qualifying assumptions are (1) normality of each time series distribution, and (2) homoscedasticity of the joint distribution between two time series.  The former can be verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test, while the latter can be demonstrated using the Breusch-Pagan test.
